# Exercise 1.17

> The exponentation algorithms in this section are based on performing exponentation by means of repeated multiplication.
> In a similar way, one can perform integer multiplication by menas of repeated addition. 
> The following multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language can only add, not multiply( is analogous to the `expt` procedure.
```scheme
(define (* a b)
    (if (= b 0)
        0
        (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))
```
> This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in _b_.
> Now suppose we include, together with addition, operations `double`, which doubles an integer, and `halve`, which divides an (even) integer by 2.
> Using these, design a multiplication procedure analogous to `fast-expt` that uses a logarithmic number of steps.

## Solution

```scheme
(define (* a b)
    (cond ((= b 0) 0)
          ((even? b) (* (double a) (halve b)))
          (else (+ a (* a (- b 1))))))

(define (even? n)
    (= (remainder  n 2) 0))

(define (double n)
    (+ n n))

(define (halve n)
    (/ n 2))
```

## Explanation

Just like in the recursive process of the exponentation procedure from exercise 1.16 we can make this procedure logarithmic in time complexity by doubling our multiplicand 
and halving our multiplier at each step where the multiplier is even.
