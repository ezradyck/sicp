# Exercise 1.9

Given the following two procedures, use the substitution model to illustrate the process generated by each in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processe iterative or recursive?

```scheme
(define (inc x)
    (+ x 1))

(define (dec x)
    (- x 1))
```


1. Given the following procedure,

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0)
        b
        (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

evaluating (+ 4 5) would result in the following process:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

As we can see from the outlined model, this procedure results in a recursive process.

2. Given the following procedure,

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0)
        b
        (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

evaluating (+ 4 5) would result in the following process:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```

As we can see, this procedure results in an iterative process.
