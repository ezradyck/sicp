# Exercise 1.10

Given Ackermann's function:

```scheme
(define (A x y)
    (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```

Compute the values of the following expressions.

1. `(A 1 10)`
    Using substitution we can model the process as:
    
    ```scheme
    (A 1 10)
    (A 0 (A 1 9))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 6)))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 5))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 4)))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 3))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2)))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 16))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 32)))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 64))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 128)))
    (A 0 (A 0 512))
    (A 0 1024)
    2048
    ```

    This means that Ackermann's function is acting as 2^y when x = 1.

1. `(A 2 4)`
    We observe the following process for this procedure:

    ```scheme
    (A 2 4)
    (A 1 (A 2 3))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1))))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 0 2)))
    (A 1 (A 1 4))
    (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 3)))
    (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2))))
    (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1)))))
    (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2))))
    (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 4)))
    (A 1 (A 0 8))
    (A 1 16)
    ...
    65536
    ```

    We can substitute the last procedure call (A 1 16) with th calculation that was determined in the previous problem (A = 2^y when x = 1).

    Based on the process of the procedure with these parameters we can determine that A x y = 2^x^y.


1. `(A 3 3)`
    Using substitution again let's inspect the following process:

    ```scheme
    (A 3 3)
    (A 2 (A 3 2))
    (A 2 (A 2 (A 3 1)))
    (A 2 (A 2 2))
    (A 2 (A 1 (A 2 1)))
    (A 2 (A 1 2))
    (A 2 (A 1 (A 0 1)))
    (A 2 (A 1 2))
    (A 2 (A 0 (A 1 1)))
    (A 2 (A 0 2))
    (A 2 4)
    ...
    65536
    ```

    This scenario contradicts our previous assumption that the algorithm could be defined as A x y = 2^x^y because 2^3^3 equals 134,217,728

Give the concise mathematical definitions for the following functions
1. `(define (f n) (A 0 n))`
    Looking at the implementation of the A procedure we can determine that the function f can be expressed as `f(n) = 2n`
1. `(define (g n ) (A 1 n))`
    Looking at the implementation of the A procedure and the process model of (A 1 10) we can say that g can be expressed as `g(n) = 0 for n = 0; 2^n for n > 0`
1. `(define (h n) (A 2 n))`
    Based on the process model of the (A 2 4) we can express h as `h(n) = 0 for n = 0; 2 for n = 1; 2^2^2^(2 ... n-times) for n > 1`
