# Exercise 1.7

recap:

```scheme
(define init-guess 1.0)

(define (good-enough? guess x)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
```

a) The `good-enough?` test will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers.

Our test will not be very effective for computing square roots of very small numbers because our tolerance is not very precise. 
The tolerance is currently hard-coded to be 0.001, which is fine when working with larger numbers, but when working with numbers less than 1 this tolerance
is quite large.

For instance, if we attempt to compute the square root of 0.0000001 our program returns 0.03125 while the actual square root is closer to 0.0003162. 

b) Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our tests inadequate for very large numbers.
