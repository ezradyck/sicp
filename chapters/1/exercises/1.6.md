# Exercise 1.6

When attempting to use the `new-if` procedure, Alyssa will run into an infinite recursive call.

To recap, the `new-if` procedure is defined as follows:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

and the `sqrt-iter` procedure is defined like so:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

The reason this `new-if` function results in infinite recursion is due to the evaluation implementation of the interpreter, which
will evaluate all parameters before passing them to a procedure, with the exception of the built-in `if` procedure, which is a special-form
procedure and is built to have its predicate evaluated first, and then one of its branches evaluated after, depending on the value of the predicate.
